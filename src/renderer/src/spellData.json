Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carries with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you shoose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave , the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Part Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction of you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacle, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or ogject in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex."

If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     At Higher Levels.

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll."

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under sertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind ( for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the atra must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, that appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding."

Toll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you it if thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. If you check fails, the devil becomes immune to you verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command--such as \"attack my enemies,\" \"explore the room ahead,\" or \"bear this message to the queen\"--until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma checks required.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th."

Its mind fills any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     At Higher Levels.

On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with and Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical coutomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk acreoss a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall--it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind must have knocked it off.<br>&nbsp&nbsp     An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature of hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."
